# Color Tiles in Godot

This is a modern clone of the classic game Color Tiles from [en.gamesaien.com](https://en.gamesaien.com/).
This game is made in Godot 4 using C# as it is my main language.

## How to play

- Click on an empty tile,
- if there are any tiles vertically or horizontally with the same color, they will be removed,
- if there are none, you loose 10 seconds of time,
- the goal of this game is to get the highest score possible in 120 seconds.

## How to build

- Clone this repository
- Open the project in Godot 4
- You can either start the game from the editor or export it to your platform of choice

## Is there anything i can do to help?

There are a couple things that are missing, like:

- Translation support, although the game should be auto-translated, it may not be of the best quality.
Some Sprites may also need to be remade to suit these translations,
- Some audio files are missing for whenever tiles are removed or the game is over, ideally, those should be made from scratch, nothing too complex,
- A better icon for the game,
- Maybe a better tileset,
- A reset button if you want to retry spam like ed
